This is a python porting of DTK library using Keras(no gpu).

Usage:

from keras_dt import *

#initialize a DT object
dt=DT(seed=<random generator seed>,dim=<dimension of arrays>,operator=<vectors composition operation>*,lexicalized=<if trees are lexicalized>)

#*only 2 operations are implemented (circular convolution and shuffled circular convolution)

#given a tree in penntree bank annotation
#call dt method
dist_tree=dt.dt(tree)
#dist_tree is a numpy array
